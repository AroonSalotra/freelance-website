## Practice Project

* Intersection Observer API Hook for animate on scroll effects
* Mobile friendly (~ 300px)
* Form section to determine price
* Support section

For this project I aimed to create a industry-level product selling website, for this I made sure to include a pricing table with comparisons, animate on scroll effects and a support section for troubleshooting.
